    "Title": "Stoned Sampler",
    "Description": "The STONED sampler uses small modifications to molecules represented as SELFIES to perform a search of the chemical space and generate new molecules. The use of string modifications in the SELFIES molecular representation bypasses the need for large amounts of data while maintaining a performance comparable to deep generative models.",
